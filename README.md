This is a project made in Unity. Made by TEAM14-ECSE211

#Introduction

This project is made for McGill Unversity ECSE211 course design principles and methods(DPM). Due to COVID-19, physical lectures and lab period are cancelled. Therefore, the initial lab part of the course is replaced with other materials. Under such constraint, this project was made.

#Rational

The purpose of this project is to simulate the course of actions that my team's robot would perform on the competition day. The simulation intents to accomplish a few goals which can be summarized as having a visual support to our documentations and showing that some physics and hardware components satisfy the constraints of our client.

#Advantage
